            <h3><span>2018 - present pro web developer</span></h3>
            <p>As the Internet has grown more complex, developers have become more specialized. That means that web development now means a lot of different things depending on what a web developer specializes in. Here are the three main categories:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sx" id="bw">
            <h2>Baby web developer</h2>
            <h3><span>2018 to 2018 learner</span></h3>
            <p>
                Front end development (the visible parts of a website, webpage, or app)
                Back end development (the “under the hood” databases and infrastructure)
                Full stack development (a hybrid of both). Full stack can apply to a web stack, mobile stack, or a native application stack (i.e. software programs for specific devices)
